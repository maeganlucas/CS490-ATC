                                        Kaldi Team Product Vision Statement
        Previous teams have utilized Kaldi to develop several automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for air traffic control (ATC) applications. 
By publishing their results under an open source license, they have laid the groundwork for future teams to build upon their work. 
Our team will build upon this foundation by creating new permutations of the previously existing ASR models using our own ATC dataset. 
Once comparing the performance of the new permutations, we will utilize the appropriate models selected to create an online speech recognizer to transcribe ATC live streams. 
The finished product for this semester will create a complete transcription of live speech input from an airplane or ATC tower.
