    Data is organized into ``trs`` files (follows an XML standard). Details in ``parse_transcripts`` function.

    Dataset can be obtained here: https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11858/00-097C-0000-0001-CCA1-0

    Notes:

        * As useful as this dataset may be, the transcriptions and their format are so convoluted and different from
            the other datasets that it may not be worth using

        * There are a lot of non-english tokens in this data that I am not sure how to filter out

        * All number readouts are space separated

        * **I'll keep working on this script to normalize the data, but I'm exluding it from the training data for now**

        * Examples of problematic lines:

            * Austrian 1 2 8 X contact (Vienna(vÃ­n)) 1 3 1 . 3 5 0 servus

        Since the transcript files correspond to wav files for ASR tasks, the transcriptions are organized into
        ``<Sync>`` elements with time attributes e.g. ``<Sync time="1.900"/>``. In this case the time attribute is ignored
        and only the text is extracted. The node hierarchy is as follows:

            * ``<Trans>`` -- root node

            * ``<Episode>`` -- empty tag (organizational?)

            * ``<Section>`` -- metadata, similar to <Turn>

            * ``<Turn>`` -- contains metadata about the duration of the audio file (attributes), serves as parent for <Sync> nodes

            * ``<Sync>`` -- holds the time (attribute) and text info (tail)

        There are also transcriber annotations present in the text, usually following a form similar to other transcripts
        for example:

            * [air]

            * [ground]

            * [unintelligible]
