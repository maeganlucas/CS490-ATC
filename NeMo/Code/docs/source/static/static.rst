Static Files
============

The static files for this project are grouped into the following four categories:

* ``images`` - For images used in webpages and otherwise served by the application

* ``js`` - For JavaScript files served by the application

* ``stylesheets`` - For the various CSS stylesheets served by the application

* ``vendor`` - For third-party libraries used by the application (primarily JavaScript libraries such as Leaflet and JQuery)

The ``static`` directory is merely a storage container for assets served by the applications. For API documentation associated with
the files in this directory (e.g. JavaScript files) see :ref:`static-files-api-reference`.

**Note that only files written for this project are documented. For third-party library documentation, see the documentation for that
specific library. It is not provided here.**
