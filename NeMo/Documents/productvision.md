NeMo Team Project Vision

By: Taylor Sumlin, Adam Fitch, Darian Hopkins, Maegan Lucas

Product Vision Statement

The NeMo team is improving upon an already existing web model that utilizes the Kaldi application to track ATC communications for pilots and visualize aircraft whilst tracking their flight data. 
A database will be developed to track and store data regarding flight position, altitude, attitude, communications, etc. This database will utilize data from ASR models provided by the Kaldi team.
