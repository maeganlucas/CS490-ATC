# Engineering Notebook - Maegan Lucas

## Semester Two - Spring 2024
### Week One (Jan. 10 - Jan. 14)
  - Talked amongst group about reassigning roles within the group.
  - Expressed desire to work on front-end development.
  - Was reassigned to front end tasks.

### Week Two (Jan. 15 - Jan. 21)
  <i> Was absent due to illness Jan. 16 - Communicated remotely </i>
  - Created a cheat sheet for the database development done last semester to help Darian and Adam.
  - Presented poster on project at the Student Poster Session at the Boeing Center of Aviation Safety
  - Shared knowledge on previous database development with Darian.
  - Emailed OpenSky to inquire about API maintence.
  - Concurred with group that it will probably be best to look into other APIs.
  - Uploaded updated project vision to GitHub.

    <strong>BLOCKER(S):</strong>
    OpenSky API down for maintence which can run for months intermittantly. After emailing, they said that it can go down at anytime. We are looking into other API's such as Flight Radar.

    - Homepage Rounded Buttons (Round the square buttons on the homepage for design consistency)
  - Continued talks with team about alternative APIs.

  - Updated the template and home page with the following changes:
    - Make header title bigger and moved the location down to the bottom of the header.
    - Removed unnecessary "Site Map" link from footer.
    - Changed footer links to match Embry-Riddle colors.
    - Changed layout of footer links.
    - Changed color gradient of header and footer bar to be lighter.
    - Removed unnecessary "Details" from footer bar in template.

    - Rounded corners of "Load Maps" button to match map toggle roundness for design consistency.

      <strong><i>Bug Introduced</i></strong><br>
