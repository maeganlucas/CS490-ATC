# Engineering Notebook - Maegan Lucas

## Semester Two - Spring 2024
### Week One (Jan. 10 - Jan. 14)
  - Talked amongst group about reassigning roles within the group.
  - Expressed desire to work on front-end development.
  - Was reassigned to front end tasks.

### Week Two (Jan. 15 - Jan. 21)
  <i> Was absent due to illness Jan. 16 - Communicated remotely </i>
  - Created a cheat sheet for the database development done last semester to help Darian and Adam.
  - Presented poster on project at the Student Poster Session at the Boeing Center of Aviation Safety
  - Shared knowledge on previous database development with Darian.
  - Emailed OpenSky to inquire about API maintence.
  - Concurred with group that it will probably be best to look into other APIs.
  - Uploaded updated project vision to GitHub.

    <strong>BLOCKER(S):</strong>
    OpenSky API down for maintence which can run for months intermittantly. After emailing, they said that it can go down at anytime. We are looking into other API's such as Flight Radar.

### Week Three (Jan. 22 - Jan. 28)
  - Determined that I will be doing tasks:
    - Riddle Aesthetic Colors (Changing the color scheme of the website to match Embry-Riddle colors)
    - Contact Us Page (Creating a contact page)
    - About Us Page (Updating About page to most up-to-date information)
    - Homepage Rounded Buttons (Round the square buttons on the homepage for design consistency)
  - Continued talks with team about alternative APIs.
